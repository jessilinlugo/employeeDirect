APIs and I have come to an agreement. We can both agree with React. It makes API calls and get requests so much simpler and straightforward. You can say I've had a difficult week; what with the breakneck speed we cover React paired with my new amazing tutor retiring to better opportunities. Although I've mentioned it before, I am so thankful to have equally amazing classmates who are willing to guide me through these concepts. 

I began with a wireframe because I had no idea how to implement my employees, before I quickly realized an excel-style layout would be best suited for the purposes. Once I got my desired information displaying I started working on the sort and filter options. 

The sorting was easy because there's a Stack Overflow question which basically had the exact code I needed. Filtering was a little trickier and that's where I spent most of my time as I went back and reviewed the last *two* weeks of lectures because that concept just completely disappeared from my brain. I wanted to sort by cities because I personally find a strange joy in seeing unusual city names in different states. Thankfully, it wasn't too difficult, and I got everything working. 

However, when I realized that the employee list didn't automatically re-render after removing some characters from the input box -- as I realized re-rendering a randomized list might cause errors - I added a Refresh Employees button to quickly reload a new list of employees to sort and filter. In a non-randomized employee directory, I imagine the refresh button would just retrieve the data again instead of simply reloading the entire page like I had to do. 

Anyway, this was a decent introduction to React. In that I learned how to alter the state, but I'm excited to re-do my portfolio with React and really dive into the front end design of my personal website.
